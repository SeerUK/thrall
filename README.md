#Â Thrall

Ultra-simple, potentially asynchronous task runner, inspired in part by Grunt and Make. Thrall is designed to allow you consolidate tasks to ease deployment by keeping the tasks required to deploy your application in your repository. It's also designed for speed; tasks can be configured to run in parallel, and Thrall is very lightweight.
